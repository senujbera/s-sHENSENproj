<h1><b>THINK BEFORE YOU BUY</b></h1>
<h4>By: Henry, Senuj YouHui</h4>
<hr>
<h2> How do the products you buy affect your community? </h2>

<p>Products you buy will strongly affect the community you live in, because if you buy local products, then you will keep the money in your community because buying a service, or a product will go to the owner, who will buy, something else locally, until it becomes taken away by the municipal government, as tax. In another scenario, you buy something that was not local, and this will make the money scatter around the globe, resulting in your community economy not growing.

<h2>What were the banana republics?</h2>
<p>“Banana Republics” are defined in political science as a politically unstable country with an economy dependent upon the export of natural resources, however we need to dive deeper if we truly want to understand what a “Banana Republic” is. The term Banana Republic can be traced back all the way to 1904, where author O. Henry Coined described Honduras and  neighbouring countries in Central America as “Banana Republics”. These countries were titled this name for their large economic exploitation by the US government in the category of banana cultivation, these countries went on to almost become completely dependent on bananas and the only outcome of this situation was more cash put into the pockets of the US elite.

<h2>What is fair trade?</h2>
<p>Fair trade is a system of certification that aims to ensure a set of standards in the production of goods and supply to give worker’s the basic set of rights they deserve. This means safe working conditions, fair pay and the right to disassociate themselves from furthermore production of the product by their hands if they actively wish to halt their work. For us it means higher quality products which are created ethically. Fair trade advocates for a thriving environment for workers and the thought for the customer that they are not supporting an unjust company that abuses their workers and puts them at risk of danger or abuse.
</p><br><br>

<h2>How to avoid purchasing products that did not originate from fair trade?</h2>
<p>Purchasing products that  originate from fair-trade can reward many benefits for yourself and the world in general.Fair trade has the ability to fight poverty, inequality and other forms of injustice all while delivering you, the customer an all around better product than an item that was created with cheap or unfair labour. Fair trade seeks greater equity in international relations and looks for better trade deals for all nations alike. Stacked on top of all of this, fair trade is necessary if we want to achieve our 17 sustainable development goals by the year 2030. Fair trade is important for you, me and everyone we know. Support fair trade by buying products that were created using it.

<h2>Chiquita’s infamous history</h2>
<p>The Chiquita brand first came to be back all the way in 1870 when Capt. Lorenzo Dow Baker purchased 160 bunches of bananas in Jamaica and resold them in Jersey city 11 days later. 3 years later, railroad developer Minor C. Keith began to play around with the idea of corporal banana production in Costa Rica. Chiquita would go on to create plantations in neighbouring countries as well, such as Honduras and El Salvador, and Chiquita, known as United Fruit at the time, would take their bananas tax free and exploit their workers for years. United Fruit was also known to be corrupt, racist and all sorts of nasty adjectives. United Fruit also planned to gain a monopoly over bananas which was highly illegal due to the Sherman Antitrust Act in 1890 which made monopolies illegal both within individual states inside the US and illegal when dealing in foreign relations and trade.
